Leon wants to know if scary or silly costumes get more Halloween candy. Leon has 20 of his friends dress in silly costumes and his brother Patrick has 20 of his friends dress in scary costumes. They plan to compare how much candy they get after trick or treating. The data are below:

```{r}
silly<- c(50,49,65,20,17,5,45,32,67,19,17,26, 31,16,10,7,17,15,24,62)
scary<- c(32,20,21,23,25,26,27,38,37,39,40,50,57,58,59,62, 45,46,56,47)
costumes<-cbind.data.frame(silly, scary)
```

```{r}
mean(costumes$silly)
mean(costumes$scary)
```

```{r}
t.test(costumes$silly, costumes$scary, var.equal= TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(effsize)
cohen.d(costumes$silly, costumes$scary)
```
