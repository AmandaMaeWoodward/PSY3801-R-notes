We are interested in whether our sample enjoys soup season more than the average person. We ask people to rate on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 10 (very much) how much they enjoy soup. We happen to know that the average person gives a rating of 5.  

## Preregistration


```{r}
data(mtcars)
t.test(mtcars$mpg, mu = 21, alternative = "two.sided")
```
